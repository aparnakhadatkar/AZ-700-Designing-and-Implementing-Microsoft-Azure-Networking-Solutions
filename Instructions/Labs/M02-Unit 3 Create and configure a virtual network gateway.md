## Task 1: Create CoreServicesVnet and ManufacturingVnet

In this task, you'll create CoreServicesVnet and ManufacturingVnet, you set up the basic Azure resources to create two virtual networks: CoreServicesVnet and ManufacturingVnet. The task involves using Azure Cloud Shell to deploy ARM templates and configure the necessary infrastructure for the upcoming tasks.

1. On the Azure portal, select the **Cloud shell** (**[>_]**)  button at the top of the page to the right of the search box. This opens a cloud shell pane at the bottom of the portal.

## Task 10: Verify that the connections connect 

In this task, you'll verify that the connections connect and you'll confirm the status of the connections between CoreServicesVnet and ManufacturingVnet. 

1. In **Search resources, services, and docs (G+/)**, enter **connections**, and then select **connections** from the results.

1. Select each connection and check the status. 

1. Wait until the status of both connections is **Connected**. You may need to refresh your screen.

## Task 11: Test the connection between the VMs

In this task, you'll test the connection between the VMs, you will verify the VNet-to-VNet connection between ManufacturingVM and CoreServicesVM. 

1. On the **ManufacturingVM**, open PowerShell.

1. Use the following command to verify that there is now a connection to CoreServicesVM on CoreServicesVnet. Be sure to use the IPv4 address for CoreServicesVM.

   ```Powershell
   Test-NetConnection 10.20.20.4 -port 3389
   ```

1. The test connection should succeed, and you will see a result similar to the following:

1. Close the Remote Desktop connection windows.

   Congratulations! You have configured a VNet-to-VNet connection by using a virtual network gateway.

## Key takeaways

Congratulations on completing the lab. Here are the main takeaways for this lab. 

+ Azure VPN Gateway is a service that provides secure connectivity between your on-premises networks and Azure virtual networks.
+ Site-to-Site (S2S) connections connect your on-premises network to an Azure virtual network using IPsec/IKE VPN tunnels. Ideal for hybrid cloud scenarios.
+ Point-to-Site (P2S) connections connnect individual clients to an Azure virtual network from remote locations. VPN protocols inlcude OpenVPN, IKEv2, or SSTP. Useful for remote workers.
+ VNet-to-VNet connections connect two or more Azure virtual networks using IPsec/IKE VPN tunnels. Suitable for multi-region or multi-VNet deployments.
+ Different VPN Gateway SKUs offer varying levels of performance, throughput, and features.
